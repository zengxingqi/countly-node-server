enterpriseinfo.pitch3 = Funnels are used to track the goal completion rates of a step by step path inside your application. Using Funnels, you can examine how your users walk through a series of events. These goals (steps) are defined as custom events in Countly.
enterpriseinfo.pitch3-title = Countly Funnels
enterpriseinfo.pitch4 = Countly is built on a powerful plugin architecture and Countly Enterprise comes packed with powerful plugins such as Drill (Advanced Segmentation), Funnels, Retention, User Profiles and many more.
enterpriseinfo.pitch4-title = Extend Countly via Plugins
enterpriseinfo.learn-more = Learn More
enterpriseinfo.contact-sales = Contact Sales
enterpriseinfo.see-in-action = See in Action
enterpriseinfo.highlights = HIGHLIGHTS
enterpriseinfo.drill-desc = Drill enables performing advanced analysis/segmentation on your data by applying AND, OR and BY filters to your segmentation properties as well as user properties such as Device, App Version, Platform, Platform Version, Session Count, Session Duration, First Session, Last Session, Country, City and Carrier.<br/><br/>With Countly Drill, you can:<ul><li>View data on a line, pie or bar chart, whichever makes more sense for the current data</li><li>Change the time bucket displayed on the chart and table to hourly, daily, weekly or monthly</li><li>View how many times your custom event occurred as well as how many users performed it and an average (times/users)</li></ul>Drill is something every data analyst should have. Say goodbye to complex SQL queries!
enterpriseinfo.funnels-desc = Using funnels you can understand where you lose your users throughout conversion paths/goals inside your application. Funnel view shows you the number of users passing through each step as well as how many times that action is performed.<br/><br/> You can filter your funnel data using any metric including custom segments you send together with your events. This enables A/B testing and comparing conversion rates within different user groups.
enterpriseinfo.retention-desc = Every company wants its customers to use their application everyday and engage with it. If they find it valuable, then they'll go on with using it, what we call "Retention". Retention is simply condition of keeping your customers. Retention page shows you active days (e.g days your customer used your application) after first session. On the retention page, you'll see a breakdown of daily, weekly and monthly retention.<br/><br/>With retention page, you can consistently monitor how much impact does each application change affect your customer. This is one of the most important metrics for mobile app analytics and is available in Enterprise Edition.
enterpriseinfo.revenue-desc = Revenue analytics lets you track in app purchase metrics with ease. Below is some of the information you will be getting from revenue analytics <ul><li>Total revenue</li> <li>Avg. revenue per user</li> <li>Avg. revenue per paying user</li> <li>Paying user count</li> <li>Paying/total users</li></ul>
enterpriseinfo.user-profiles-desc = Countly Profiles enables you to track everything you need to know about your customer and how they use your apps. Track information like name, email, location and gender, or add custom data.<br/><br/> Have an overview of who logged in, and what they’ve done in their session. Get detailed user behaviour information.<br/><br/> Create a funnel and track user’s progress through that funnel<br/><br/>
enterpriseinfo.attribution-desc = Attribution analytics allows you to measure your marketing campaign performance by attributing installs from specific campaigns.<br/><br/>Additionally you can target users from different platforms differently, by providing specific end URL for each platform and Countly will automatically redirect visitor to specific URL based on what platform visitor is using.<br/><br/>You can also manage single campaign with single Countly generated URL for both Android and iOS users each pointing to their own app market link.
enterpriseinfo.flows-desc = A flow visualization is a graphic that a traces a route or a path. With Flows, it's possible to see the steps users take to reach each page, or each event, depending on whether you track web pages or mobile apps. You can apply any filter like device, city, country, local hour, carrier and more. Each bubble can represent number of sessions or number of users. Since it's possible to segment with campaign, it's possible how traffic is engaging with your content and look for especially overperforming or underperforming campaigns or sources.
enterpriseinfo.scalability-desc = Countly Enterprise Edition has a different architecture than Community Edition, where it can serve tens of billions of hits per month on a scalable infrastructure and is available for customers in need of a bigdata solution for mobile analytics.<br/><br/>To meet the sustained performance and scalability of ever increasing data and query, Countly Enterprise Edition has a sharding and replicaset mechanism designed to distribute overhead to several machines. You can deploy any number of servers and scale to your desired environment while preserving single pane of monitoring and reporting.
enterpriseinfo.support-desc = Countly Enterprise Edition comes with support and SLA agreement from the same team who build Countly from ground up. You can also get 2-day training on-site where you'll learn foundations of Countly, scaling Countly, reporting, dashboard customization and mobile device SDKs thoroughly.<br/><br/>A comprehensive support program for Countly Enterprise Edition includes orientation programs, technical support for IT, one-on-one expert sessions, online tutorials and more.
enterpriseinfo.raw-data-desc = It's important that you can access your Countly mobile analytics data when you want it, where you want it - whether is it to import it into another service or just create your own copy for your archives. Self-hosted Countly Enterprise Edition does exactly that: You own your database, you own your data - it's solely your property.<br/><br/>Countly Enterprise Edition also allows you download your stored data in CSV and XLS formats, allowing your data scientists to visualize information the way your company managers want. This saves time and energy, instead of spending time with trying to extract data using command line utilities.
